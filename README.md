 <h1 align="center"> The fowards or backwards time planner</h1>

This app is a one busy day planner / time calculator enabling you to list a number of tasks and set a final time for when you need to finish them. You build up a list of things to do, set how long each task lasts (eg a train journey), add some waiting time (eg trains run every 15 minutes) and the app calculates when you need to start out. Day plans are saved anonymously, a link can be shared and be edited by another person in real time. You can save the task to your diary as well as set a start time to calculate a finish time.
